            <h3>Mulching</h3>
            <p>
                Mulching is one of the fastest and most affordable ways to improve the look of your property. 
                We install premium mulch in a variety of colors and materials to reduce weeds, retain moisture, and create a crisp, polished appearance.
            </p>

            <h3>Hardscaping & Rock Installation</h3>
            <p>
                Decorative stone borders, rock beds, walkways, and retaining walls—we design and install durable hardscapes that elevate your landscape while reducing long-term maintenance.
            </p>

            <h3>Tree & Shrub Trimming</h3>
            <p>
                Keep your outdoor space healthy and well-maintained with professional trimming and pruning. 
                We remove dead branches, shape shrubs, and restore balance to overgrown areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Tree Removal & Stump Grinding</h3>
            <p>
                Our team safely removes hazardous or unwanted trees and grinds stumps below ground level, allowing you to reclaim your yard and prepare for new landscaping.
            </p>
