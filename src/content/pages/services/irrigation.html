            <h2>Our Irrigation Services</h2>

            <h3>Start-Ups</h3>
            <p>
                Each spring, we inspect and restart your sprinkler system to ensure it’s free of debris and running at peak efficiency. 
                We check for leaks, adjust heads, and verify proper coverage before your first watering cycle.
            </p>

            <h3>Shut-Downs (Winterization)</h3>
            <p>
                Michigan winters can cause costly damage if irrigation lines aren’t properly blown out. 
                We use professional air compression equipment to clear every line and guarantee freeze protection — 
                and if your system was shut down by us and still experiences freeze damage, we’ll warranty the repairs.
            </p>

            <p>
                We repair leaks, replace broken sprinkler heads, fix wiring and control boxes, and service all brands of irrigation systems. 
                Whether it’s a small fix or a 15-zone repair, we’ve got it covered.
            </p>

            <h3>Backflow Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Protect your water supply and stay compliant with local regulations through annual backflow testing. 
                We’re equipped to test, certify, and repair backflow preventers for residential and commercial systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Control Box & Timer Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                Upgrade your outdated irrigation controls with smart or manual timer replacements. 
                We’ll help you set efficient watering schedules that reduce waste and lower your water bill.
