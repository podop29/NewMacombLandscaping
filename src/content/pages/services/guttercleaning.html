      <h3>Prevent Water Damage with Professional Gutter Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Clogged gutters can lead to roof leaks, fascia rot, foundation issues, and messy exterior staining. 
        Macomb Landscaping Services provides thorough, safe, and reliable gutter cleaning for homes and businesses across Macomb, Shelby Township, Chesterfield, and nearby communities.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Underground Buried Gutter Drainage</h3>
      <p>
        Looking for a more permanent solution? We also install <strong>underground buried gutter drainage systems</strong> that connect your downspouts to buried PVC pipes, directing water safely away from your foundation. This eliminates surface runoff, prevents erosion and foundation issues, and keeps your landscaping clean and dry year-round.
      </p>
